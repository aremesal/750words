# 750words

This project is based on Julia Cameron's _Morning Pages_, as she proposed it in her The Artist's Way book. The project born as an exercise to learn about NoSQL databases  (MongoDB) while developing something simple and usefull. From I liked what I built, I wish to keep it open at 750palabras.alvaroremesal.com and keep the source code open for anyone who wants to learn about NoSQL from PHP.

## Framework

750words use the [CodeIgniter framework](http://codeigniter.com/). It's a small and lightweight framework, all of its code is within the project.
